
Fizz
====

Fizz is a library for rendering in an old physics textbook style. It's a 
reimplementation of @jemmybutton's [Fiziko library][1].

Example
=======

See [demo page][4] for example and parameters (there are a lot of them)

Why?
====

I really liked Fiziko when I ran across it, and I wanted to tinker with it, but 
the language it's written in -- [MetaPost][3] -- is almost incomprehensible to 
me. Rather than trying to get it working I reimplemented it (some of it, anyway) 
in typescript, targeting SVG and canvas.
